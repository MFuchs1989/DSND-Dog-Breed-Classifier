# Data Scientist Nanodegree: Capstone Project


![dog_breed_main_pic](images/dog_breed_main_pic.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict dog breeds. The pipeline is the evaluation of an image as a dog or a human, then a prediction of which dog breed the dog is, or which dog breed the human most resembles. 

How I proceeded exactly and what results I achieved can be read in my blog post: (LINK)

## Introduction

In the course of this nanodegree from Udacity, as part of the Capstone project, I created a pipeline that can be used in a web or mobile app to process real images taken by users. Based on a picture of a dog, the algorithm I created can make an assessment about the dog breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

## Project Motivation: 

Udacity has given students the freedom to choose the area in which they would like to complete their capstone project. Possible technical fields would have been:

+ [Robot Motion Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZFCH6jS3A5At7_v5IUM5OpAXJYiutFuSIjTzV_E-vdE/pub)
+ [Healthcare](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WzurKKa9AX2DnOH7KiB38mvozdOSemfkGpex8hdTy8c/pub)
+ [Computer Vision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y-XfjkPFgUQxFIQ9bBncUSjs4HOf5E-45FrLYNBsZb4/pub)
+ [Education](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vjerjRQnWs1kLbZagDYT6rNqiwAG23Yj45oUY88IAxI/pub)
+ [Investment and Trading](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ycGeb1QYKATG6jvz74SAMqxrlek9Ed4RYrzWNhWS-0Q/pub)

As I am personally very interested in Deep Learning and have already completed my Nanodegree in Computer Vision via Udacity, I found it exciting to complete my capstone project in this area as well. 
So I choose to use Convolutional Neural Networks to Identify Dog Breeds.
