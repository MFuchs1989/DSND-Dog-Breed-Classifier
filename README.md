# Data Scientist Nanodegree: Capstone Project


![dog_breed_main_pic](images/dog_breed_main_pic.jpg)

The purpose of this project is to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict dog breeds. The pipeline is the evaluation of an image as a dog or a human, then a prediction of which dog breed the dog is, or which dog breed the human most resembles. 

How I proceeded exactly and what results I achieved can be read in my blog post: (LINK)

## Introduction

In the course of this nanodegree from Udacity, as part of the Capstone project, I created a pipeline that can be used in a web or mobile app to process real images taken by users. Based on a picture of a dog, the algorithm I created can make an assessment about the dog breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
